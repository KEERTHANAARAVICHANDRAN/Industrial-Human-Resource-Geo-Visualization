# Industrial-Human-Resource-Geo-Visualization

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Programming Language
- **pandas**: Python Library for Data Visualization
- **numpy**: Fundamental Python package for scientific computing in Python
- **streamlit**: Python framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps
- **scikit-learn**: Machine Learning library for the Python programming language
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: A library in Python for working with human language data, including tokenization, stemming, tagging, and more.

- ## Approach:
1. **Data Merging**: Merge provided CSV data files to create a comprehensive DataFrame.
2. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**: Explore and clean the data, addressing issues such as missing values and inconsistencies.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and categorize industries into groups such as Retail, Poultry, Agriculture, and Manufacturing.
4. **Machine Learning**: Perform machine learning tasks, including training a model to predict relevant workforce features.
5. **Geo-Visualization**: Develop a dashboard app using Streamlit and Plotly to visually represent the distribution of workers across various industries with respect to different geographical regions.
